# Need for Control Flow

- **Control flow in programming lets you decide what code runs and when, based on conditions or loops.**
- Without it, programs would just run straight through once.
- For example, use "if" to check something and do different things, or loops to repeat tasks.
- It's like giving directions: "If it's raining, take an umbrella; otherwise, don't."
- This makes programs flexible and useful, like handling user input or repeating actions in scripts.
- In Python, tools like `if`, `for`, and `while` control the flow.
