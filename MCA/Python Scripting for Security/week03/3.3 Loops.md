# 3.3 Loops

Loops execute code repeatedly. Python has `for` and `while` loops, plus nested loops.

---

## For Loop
Iterates over a sequence (list, string, etc.) or range.

**Syntax:**
```python
for element in sequence:
    # code
```

**Examples:**

Iterate over range:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):  # Loop from 1 to 5
    print(i)  # Print the current i
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

Iterate over string:
```python
for char in "hello":  # Loop over each character in "hello"
    print(char)  # Print the character
# Output: h e l l o
```

With index:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana']  # List of fruits
for i in range(len(fruits)):  # Loop over indices
    print(i, fruits[i])  # Print index and fruit
# Output: 0 apple
# 1 banana
```

With else:
```python
for item in ['a', 'b']:  # Loop over list
    print(item)  # Print item
else:  # After loop
    print("Done")  # Print done
# Output: a b Done
```

Printing elements from a list:
```python
cars = ["Tata", "Honda", "Mahindra", "Suzuki", "BMW"]  # List of car brands
for brand in cars:  # Loop over each brand
    print(brand)  # Print the brand
# Output:
# Tata
# Honda
# Mahindra
# Suzuki
# BMW
```

Calculating factorial:
```python
num = int(input("Enter a Number: "))  # Get number input
fact = 1  # Initialize factorial
if num < 0:  # If negative
    print("Not Defined!")  # Error message
elif num == 0 or num == 1:  # If 0 or 1
    print(f"{num}! = {fact}")  # Print 1
else:  # Else
    for i in range(2, num + 1):  # Loop to calculate factorial
        fact *= i  # Multiply
    print(f"{num}! = {fact}")  # Print result
# Example output for input 5: 5! = 120
```

---

## While Loop
Executes while condition is True.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # code
```

**Example:**
```python
counter = 1  # Initialize counter
while counter <= 3:  # While counter <=3
    print("Loop")  # Print loop
    counter += 1  # Increment counter
# Output: Loop Loop Loop
```

With else:
```python
counter = 0  # Initialize counter
while counter < 2:  # While <2
    print(counter)  # Print counter
    counter += 1  # Increment
else:  # After loop
    print("End")  # Print end
# Output: 0 1 End
```

Infinite loop (avoid):
```python
while True:  # Infinite loop
    print("Infinite")  # Print infinite
# Runs forever
```

Finding numbers divisible by 5 or 7:
```python
i = 1  # Initialize i
while i < 50:  # While i <50
    if i % 5 == 0 or i % 7 == 0:  # If divisible by 5 or 7
        print(i, end=' ')  # Print i with space
    i += 1  # Increment i
# Output: 5 7 10 14 15 20 21 25 28 30 35 40 42 45 49
```

Calculating sum of squares:
```python
sum_sq = 0  # Initialize sum
counter = 1  # Initialize counter
while counter <= 15:  # While <=15
    sum_sq += counter ** 2  # Add square
    counter += 1  # Increment
print("Sum of squares:", sum_sq)  # Print sum
# Output: Sum of squares: 1240
```

Checking if a number is prime:
```python
def is_prime(num):  # Function to check prime
    if num <= 1:  # If <=1
        return False  # Not prime
    i = 2  # Start from 2
    while i * i <= num:  # While i^2 <= num
        if num % i == 0:  # If divisible
            return False  # Not prime
        i += 1  # Next i
    return True  # Prime

print(is_prime(23))  # True
print(is_prime(4))   # False
```

Creating multiplication table:
```python
num = 5  # Number for table
counter = 1  # Initialize counter
while counter <= 10:  # While <=10
    print(f"{num} x {counter} = {num * counter}")  # Print multiplication
    counter += 1  # Increment
# Output:
# 5 x 1 = 5
# ...
# 5 x 10 = 50
```

## Using Counter Variables
Counter variables track the number of loop iterations.

- Initialize the counter before the loop.
- Use it in the loop condition (for while loops).
- Increment it inside the loop.

**Examples:**

Basic while loop counter:
```python
count = 0  # Initialize count
while count < 5:  # While <5
    print("Iteration", count)  # Print iteration
    count += 1  # Increment
# Output: Iteration 0
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
```

Counter with step (increment by 2):
```python
count = 0  # Initialize count
while count < 10:  # While <10
    print("Count:", count)  # Print count
    count += 2  # Increment by 2
# Output: Count: 0
Count: 2
Count: 4
Count: 6
Count: 8
```

Counting items in a list with while:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # List of numbers
index = 0  # Initialize index
while index < len(numbers):  # While index < length
    print("Item", index, ":", numbers[index])  # Print item
    index += 1  # Increment index
# Output: Item 0 : 1
Item 1 : 2
... up to Item 4 : 5
```

In for loops, use `range()` or `enumerate()` for counters.

For loop with range as counter:
```python
for count in range(5):  # Loop from 0 to 4
    print("Count:", count)  # Print count
    # This will print the numbers 0 through 4
# Output: Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
```

Using enumerate for counter and value:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  # List of fruits
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):  # Loop with index and fruit
    print("Fruit", index, ":", fruit)  # Print index and fruit
    # This will print both the index and the fruit
# Output: Fruit 0 : apple
Fruit 1 : banana
Fruit 2 : cherry
```

Counting items with condition in for loop:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Assign list of numbers to numbers
even_count = 0  # Initialize even_count to 0
for num in numbers:  # Loop over each num in numbers
    if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if num is even
        even_count += 1  # Increment even_count
print("Even numbers:", even_count)  # Print the count of even numbers
# Output: Even numbers: 3

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_count = 0
for i in range(len(numbers)):
	num = numbers[i]  # Get the current number
	if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
		print(f"Even number: {num} at index {i}")  # Print the even number and its index
		even_count += 1  # Increment the count of even numbers
print("Total even numbers:", even_count)  # Print the total count of even numbers
		even_count += 1
print("Total even numbers:", even_count)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # List of numbers
even_count = 0  # Initialize even count
index = 0  # Manual counter for index
for num in numbers:  # Loop over numbers
	if num % 2 == 0:  # If even
		print(f"Even number: {num} at index {index}")  # Print even number and index
		even_count += 1  # Increment count
		index += 1  # Increment index
print("Total even numbers:", even_count)  # Print total

# Output:

# Even number: 2 at index 1
# Even number: 4 at index 3
# Even number: 6 at index 5
# Total even numbers: 3
```

Summing with counter in for loop:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Assign list of numbers to numbers
total = 0  # Initialize total to 0
for num in numbers:  # Loop over each num in numbers
    total += num  # Add num to total
print("Total:", total)  # Print the total sum
# Output: Total: 15
```

---

## Nested Loops
Loop inside another loop.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop for rows
    for j in range(1, i+1):  # Inner loop for columns
        print("*", end=" ")  # Print * with space
    print()  # New line after each row
# Output:
# *
# * *
# * * *
```

---

## Loop Control Statements

- `break`: Exits loop immediately.
- `continue`: Skips to next iteration.
- `pass`: Placeholder, does nothing.

**Example:**
```python
# continue
for i in range(5):  # Loop from 0 to 4
    if i == 2:  # Check if i is 2
        continue  # Skip to next iteration
    print(i)  # Print i
# Output: 0 1 3 4

# break
for i in range(5):  # Loop from 0 to 4
    if i == 3:  # Check if i is 3
        break  # Exit the loop
    print(i)  # Print i
# Output: 0 1 2

# pass
for i in range(3):  # Loop from 0 to 2
    if i == 1:  # Check if i is 1
        pass  # Do nothing
    else:
        print(i)  # Print i
# Output: 0 2
```
