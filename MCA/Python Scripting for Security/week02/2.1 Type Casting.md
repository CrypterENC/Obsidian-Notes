### **First what is Type Errors ?** 
A **TypeError** in Python is a built-in exception raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

-  In the above image, the valve of `my_number` is of type " string ".
- Now we won't be able to add valves of other type to this number. like:
```python
<class 'str'>
Adding my_number to 10 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\mathe\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\python_scripting_for_security_exercises\python\type_casting.py", line 10, in <module>
    print(my_number + 10)
          ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```
- Now to solve this error: We need to use **Type Casting** also called **Type conversion.**
### **Types of Python Type Casting**
Type casting in Python is classified into two types:

- **Implicit Type Casting -** **The Python interpreter automatically converts one data type into another without user intervention.**

	-  Python follows a hierarchy of data types to ensure safe implicit conversions. The hierarchy is as follows:
		- `int` -->  `float` --> `complex`
```python
# Simple program to show implicit type casting

# Initializing variables
a = 5  # Assign integer value 5 to variable a
b = 7.6  # Assign float value 7.6 to variable b
c = 3 + 4j  # Assign complex number 3+4j to variable c

# Implicit type casting
d = a + b  # Add a and b, resulting in float due to implicit conversion
e = a + b + c  # Add a, b, and c, resulting in complex due to implicit conversion
print(d, '=>', type(d))  # Print the value of d, '=>', and the type of d
print(e, '=>', type(e))  # Print the value of e, '=>', and the type of e

# Output
12.6 => <class 'float'>
(15.6+4j) => <class 'complex'>
```

- **Explicit Type Casting -** **The user manually converts a variable's data type by using built-in capabilities.**

>**Explicit Type Casting**, also known as **Type Conversion**, is when the programmer manually changes the type of a variable or value by calling Python's built-in function such as int(), float(), str(), and more.
