# 2.8 String Methods

Strings have built-in methods for manipulation.

## .find()
Finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring. Returns -1 if not found.

```python
a = "hello"  # Assign the string 'hello' to variable a
print(a.find('e'))  # Print the index of the first 'e' in a
print(a.find('z'))  # Print the index of 'z' in a (returns -1 if not found)
```

## .replace()
Replaces occurrences of a substring with another.

```python
a = "this is a nice dog and I love him"  # Assign the string to variable a
print(a.replace("dog", "cat"))  # Replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a and print the result
```

## .endswith()
Checks if the string ends with a specified suffix.

```python
a = "hello"  # Assign the string 'hello' to variable a
print(a.endswith("lo"))  # Print whether a ends with 'lo'
print(a.endswith("he"))  # Print whether a ends with 'he'
```

## 'in' Operator
Checks for membership in the string.

```python
a = "this is a nice dog and I love him"  # Assign the string to variable a
print('dog' in a)  # Print whether 'dog' is in a
print('cat' in a)  # Print whether 'cat' is in a
```

Practice using these methods with examples.
