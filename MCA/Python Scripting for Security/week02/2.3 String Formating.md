### **Why Format Strings ?** 
- We use strings to represent human language within programming.
#### **Some of these methods are discussed below:**
##### **1. Using f-strings**

```python
name = "John"  # Assign the string "John" to variable name
age = 19  # Assign the integer 19 to variable age
city = "New York"  # Assign the string "New York" to variable city

# Using f-string
print(f'{name} is a {age} years old boy living in {city}.')  # Print formatted string using f-string

# Output:
John is a 19 years old boy living in New York.
```
##### **Using .format()**

```python
name = "Sachin"  # Assign the string "Sachin" to variable name
profession = "Software Developer"  # Assign the string "Software Developer" to variable profession
company = "Apple Inc"  # Assign the string "Apple Inc" to variable company

# Using the format() method
msg = '{} is a {} at {}.'.format(name, profession, company)  # Format the string using format method
print(msg)  # Print the formatted message

# Output
Sachin is a Software Developer at Apple Inc.
