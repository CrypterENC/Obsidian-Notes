## What is Recursion?

Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.

## Example: Factorial

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)  # Recursive call: multiply n by factorial of n-1

print(factorial(5))  # 120
```

Factorial of a number n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. The function calculates this recursively by multiplying n with the factorial of (n-1), and the base case is 0! = 1.

## Example: Fibonacci

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:  # Base cases: fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)  # Sum of previous two

print(fibonacci(5))  # 5
```

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... The function calculates the nth number in this sequence using recursion by adding the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers.

## Important Notes

- Base case to stop recursion.
- Can cause stack overflow if too deep.

## More Examples

### Sum of List

```python
def sum_list(lst):
    if not lst:  # Base case: empty list sum is 0
        return 0
    return lst[0] + sum_list(lst[1:])  # Add first element to sum of rest

print(sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # 10
```

### Reverse String

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    if len(s) == 0:  # Base case: empty string is empty
        return s
    return reverse_string(s[1:]) + s[0]  # Reverse rest and add first char

print(reverse_string("hello"))  # "olleh"
```

### Power

```python
def power(base, exp):
    if exp == 0:  # Base case: any number to power 0 is 1
        return 1
    return base * power(base, exp - 1)  # Multiply base by power of base^(exp-1)

print(power(2, 3))  # 8
```
