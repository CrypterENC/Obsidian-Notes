# 1.12 Reading Strings

## Strings
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Examples:
```python
'hello'  # Example of a string in single quotes
"My name is Vaishnavi"  # Example of a string in double quotes
"abc123"  # Example of a string with letters and numbers
```

Use double quotes if the string contains single quotes, and vice versa.

```python
print("Hello, my name is 'John'")  # Print the string with single quotes inside double quotes
# Output: Hello, my name is 'John'
```

## String Operations

### Concatenation
Combine strings with `+`.

```python
a = 'Vaishnavi '  # Assign the string 'Vaishnavi ' to variable a
b = 'Gopalasamy'  # Assign the string 'Gopalasamy' to variable b
c = a + b  # Concatenate a and b and assign to c
print(c)  # Print the concatenated string c
```

### Find
Check if a character or substring exists and get its index (starting from 0). Returns -1 if not found.

```python
a = "We're learning how to find characters"  # Assign the string to variable a
print(a.find('f'))  # Print the index of the first 'f' in a
```

### Length
Get the number of characters with `len()`.

```python
a = 'hello'  # Assign the string 'hello' to variable a
print(len(a))  # Print the length of a
```

### Multiplication
Repeat strings with `*`.

```python
a = "hello"  # Assign the string 'hello' to variable a
print(a * 5)  # Print a repeated 5 times
```

## Conclusion
Strings are one of the most basic datatypes in python and extremely useful. They are used to encode human readable words, text, speech, everything that you want in a language..
