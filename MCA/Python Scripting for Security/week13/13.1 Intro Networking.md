# 🌐 Introduction to Networking

## ❓ What is Networking?
- Networking **connects devices** to share resources, data, and communicate.
- Involves **hardware** (routers, switches) and **software** (protocols).
- Enables internet, local networks, and device-to-device communication.

## 🏠 Types of Networking

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **LAN (Local Area Network)** | Small network, high speed, limited area. | Home/office network. |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)** | Large network connecting multiple LANs. | The internet. |
| **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** | City-wide network. | Cable TV network in a city. |
| **PAN (Personal Area Network)** | Very small, device-to-device. | Bluetooth between phone and headset. |
| **Wireless Networks** | Wi-Fi, cellular (4G/5G). | Wi-Fi hotspots. |
| **Wired Networks** | Ethernet cables. | Office wired connections. |

## 🔌 Internet Protocols

| Protocol | Description | Example Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **TCP/IP** | Core suite: TCP for reliable data, IP for addressing. | Web browsing, email. |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Web communication; HTTPS is encrypted. | Loading websites. |
| **FTP** | File transfer. | Uploading files to server. |
| **SMTP/POP3/IMAP** | Email sending/receiving. | Gmail, Outlook. |
| **DNS** | Translates domain names to IP addresses. | Resolving google.com to IP. |
| **UDP** | Fast, connectionless, no reliability guarantee. | Video streaming, VoIP. |

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **IP Address**: Unique device identifier (e.g., `192.168.1.1` for IPv4, longer for IPv6).
- **Ports**: Service endpoints (e.g., `80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS).
- **Packets**: Data units sent over networks.
- **Routers/Switches**: Direct network traffic.
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer speed.
- **Latency**: Delay in data transmission.

## 📝 Notes
- Networking is fundamental to modern computing and security.
- Protocols ensure reliable and secure communication.
- Understanding these basics helps in programming network applications.
