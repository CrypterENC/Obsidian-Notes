## Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are different ways to think about and organize code.

- **Procedural Programming**:
  - Code is written as a **series of steps or functions that operate on data.**
  - It's like a recipe **where you list the instructions step by step.**
  - Focuses on **procedures or subroutines** that manipulate global variables and state.
  - Uses control structures like loops and conditionals.
  - Examples: C, Pascal.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - Uses **objects that combine data (attributes) and methods (functions)** into a single unit.
  - Models real-world entities and their interactions.
  - Key features include classes (blueprints for objects), inheritance (reusing code from parent classes), encapsulation (hiding internal details), and polymorphism (objects behaving differently based on context).
  - Examples: Java, Python.

- **Imperative Programming**: Describes how to do tasks step by step, changing program state. Includes procedural and object-oriented programming.
- **Declarative Programming**: Describes what the program should accomplish, not the steps. Includes functional and logic programming.

## 1.1 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm ~={yellow}that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.=~ It utilizes several techniques from previously ~={yellow}established paradigms, including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation.=~

## Why Use OOP?

OOP provides several benefits over procedural programming:

- **Modularity**: Code is organized into self-contained objects, making it easier to manage and debug.
- **Reusability**: Through mechanisms like inheritance, code can be reused across different parts of the program.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one object do not affect others, simplifying updates and expansions.
- **Abstraction**: Focuses on essential features while hiding unnecessary details.

## Key Principles of OOP

OOP is built on four main principles:

### 1. ~={red}Encapsulation=~
- Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
- Data hiding: Restricting access to certain components to prevent accidental modification.
- Achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `public`, etc. (in languages like Java).

### 2. ~={red}Inheritance=~
- Mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class).
- Allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from the superclass.
- Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship.

### 3. ~={red}Polymorphism=~
- Ability of objects to take on multiple forms.
- Includes method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
- Enables a single interface to be used for different data types or classes.

### 4. ~={red}Abstraction=~
- Process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
- Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
- Helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.

## Classes and Objects

### ~={red}Class=~
- A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- Defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.
- Example: A `Car` class might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and methods like `start()`, `drive()`.
### ~={red}Object=~
- An instance of a class.
- Represents a specific entity with its own set of attribute values.
- Example: A specific car object with color "red" and model "Sedan".
