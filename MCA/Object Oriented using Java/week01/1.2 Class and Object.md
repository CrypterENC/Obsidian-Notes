## Example of Object

```java
class Dog {
    String name;   //State
    void bark() {  //Method
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();    //Creating an object
        myDog.name = "Rocky";     //Assigning value to the object
        myDog.bark();             //Calling the method
    }
}
```

Output: Rocky says Woof!
