## **What is Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)?**

- **Definition:** Software that handles all communication between hardware and the kernel
- **Kernel:** Core of the operating system with complete control over the entire computer
- **Kernel Responsibilities:**
  - Handles all input and output operations
  - Manages memory allocation and access
  - Controls all connected devices

## **User Mode vs Kernel Mode**

- **CPU Operating Modes:** The CPU operates in 2 different modes

  **1. User Mode:**
  - Where installed applications run
  - Restricted address space created for each application
  - Each app has its own dedicated process

  **2. Kernel Mode:**
  - Where the operating system runs
  - All kernel code shares the same address space
  - If kernel code fails, the entire OS crashes

## **Windows File Systems**

### **What is a File System?**

- **Definition:** How information is organized on storage media
- **Purpose:** Determines how data is stored, accessed, and managed
- **Selection Criteria:** Depends on the type of media being used

### **NTFS (New Technology File System)**

**Why NTFS is Most Widely Used:**

- Supports very large files and partitions
- Highly compatible with other operating systems
- Very reliable with recovery features
- Extensive security features
- File system encryption support

**Security Features:**

- **Data Access Control:** Achieved through security descriptors
- **Permissions:** File ownership and permissions down to file level
- **Timestamps (MACE):**
  - **M**odify - When file was last modified
  - **A**ccess - When file was last accessed
  - **C**reate - When file was created
  - **E**ntry Modified - When file metadata changed
- **Forensic Value:** Used in investigations to determine file/folder history

### **Partitioning and Formatting**

- **Partitions:** Hard drive divided into logical storage units
- **Process:** Device must be partitioned → formatted with file system
- **Automatic Setup:** Most OSs automatically partition and format during installation

### **NTFS Disk Structures**

1. **Partition Boot Sector**
   - First 16 sectors of the drive
   - Contains location of Master File Table (MFT)
   - Last 16 sectors contain backup copy

2. **Master File Table (MFT)**
   - Contains locations of all files and directories
   - Stores file attributes (security info, timestamps)

3. **System Files**
   - Hidden files
   - Store information about volumes and file attributes

4. **File Area**
   - Main partition area
   - Stores actual files and directories

### **Data Recovery Security Risk**

- ⚠️ **Important:** Previous data may be recoverable after formatting
- **Why:** Not all data is completely removed
- **Solution:** Perform **secure wipe** on reused drives
- **How:** Writes data multiple times to ensure no remaining data

### **Alternate Data Streams (ADS)**

**What are ADSs?**

- NTFS stores files as series of attributes (name, timestamp, etc.)
- Data stored in attribute `$DATA` = data stream
- **ADS:** Additional data streams attached to files

**Common Uses:**

- Applications store additional file information
- Metadata storage

**Security Concern:**

- ⚠️ Easy to hide data in ADS
- Attackers can store malicious code in ADS
- Code can be called from different files
- Important factor in malware analysis

**Identification:**

- Format: `Filename.txt:ADS`
- Example: `Testfile.txt:ADS` indicates ADS called "ADS" attached to Testfile.txt

## **Windows Boot Process**

### **Overview**

- Multiple actions occur from power button press to full Windows load
- Known as the **Windows Boot Process**

### **Computer Firmware Types**

**1. BIOS (Basic Input-Output System)**

- Created in early 1980s
- Works same way as original design
- Difficulty supporting new features as computers evolved

**2. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**

- Designed to replace BIOS
- Supports modern features
- Greater visibility into boot process

### **BIOS Boot Process**

**Initialization Phase:**

- Hardware devices initialized
- Power-On Self-Test (POST) performed
- Verifies all devices communicating
- Ends when system disk discovered

**Loading OS:**

- POST looks for Master Boot Record (MBR)
- MBR contains small program to locate and load OS
- BIOS executes this code
- Operating system starts loading

### **UEFI Boot Process**

**Key Differences:**

- Loads EFI program files (`.efi` files)
- Stored in special disk partition: **EFI System Partition (ESP)**
- Direct entry to protected mode
- Enhanced security at boot time

### **Windows Boot Sequence (BIOS or UEFI)**

**1. Bootmgr.exe Execution**

- Switches system from real mode → protected mode
- Enables use of all system memory

**2. Boot Configuration Database (BCD)**

- Bootmgr.exe reads BCD
- Contains additional startup code
- Indicates: hibernation resume OR cold start

**3. Hibernation Resume Path**

- If resuming from hibernation:
  - Winresume.exe runs
  - Reads Hiberfil.sys file
  - Restores computer state

**4. Cold Start Path**

- If fresh boot:
  - Winload.exe loads
  - Creates hardware configuration record in registry
  - Uses Kernel Mode Code Signing (KMCS)
  - Verifies all drivers digitally signed
  - Ensures safe driver loading

**5. Kernel Initialization**

- Winload.exe runs Ntoskrnl.exe
- Starts Windows kernel
- Sets up HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

**6. User Environment Setup**

- Session Manager Subsystem (SMSS) reads registry
- Creates user environment
- Starts Winlogon service
- Prepares each user's desktop for login

---

## **Windows Startup**

### **Registry Keys for Auto-Start**

**1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**

- Contains services that start only when user logs on

### **Startup Entry Types**

- Run
- RunOnce
- RunServices
- RunServicesOnce
- Userinit

### **Configuration Methods**

- **Manual:** Directly edit registry (not recommended)
- **Safe Method:** Use **Msconfig.exe** tool
  - View all startup options
  - Change startup settings
  - Access via search box

---

## **Windows Shutdown**

### **Best Practice**

- Always perform proper shutdown
- Prevents file corruption and data loss

### **Why Proper Shutdown Matters**

- Records configuration changes before power loss

### **Shutdown Process**

**Order of Operations:**

1. User mode applications close first
2. Kernel mode processes close second

**Unresponsive Process Handling:**

- **User Mode:** OS displays notification, allows wait or force end
- **Kernel Mode:** Shutdown appears to hang, may need power button

### **Shutdown Methods**

- Start menu power options
- Command line: `shutdown` command
- Ctrl+Alt+Delete → Power icon

### **Shutdown Options**

**1. Shutdown**

- Turns computer off (power off)

**2. Restart**

- Reboots computer (power off → power on)

**3. Hibernate**

- Records current computer state
- Stores in file
- User resumes with all files/programs still open
- Faster than cold start

---

## **Windows Configuration and Monitoring**

## **Linux Roles and File Permissions**

### **File Permissions Concept**

**Philosophy:**

- Most system entities treated as files
- File permissions organize system and enforce boundaries

**Permission Mechanism:**

- Built into file system structure
- Define actions owner, group, others can perform

**Permission Rights:**

- **R** (Read) - View file contents
- **W** (Write) - Modify file contents
- **X** (Execute) - Run file as program

### **Permission Display: ls -l Command**

**Output Format:**

- Provides extensive file information
- Displays permissions in User, Group, Other order

**Example: `-rwxrw-r--`**

**Permission Breakdown:**

- **First character:** `-` = file, `d` = directory
- **Characters 2-4 (User):** `rwx` = owner can read, write, execute
- **Characters 5-7 (Group):** `rw-` = group can read, write (not execute)
- **Characters 8-10 (Other):** `r--` = others can only read

### **File Information Fields**

**1. Permissions** - User, Group, Other rights

**2. Hard Links Count** - Number of hard links to file

**3. Owner** - User who owns file

**4. Group** - Group that owns file

**5. File Size** - In bytes

**6. Modification Date/Time** - Last change timestamp

**7. File Name** - Name of file

### **Permission Enforcement**

**Fundamental Rule:**

- File permissions cannot be broken
- User has only rights permissions allow

**Root User Exception:**

- Only root user can override file permissions
- Root can write to any file
- Root has full OS control

**Root Access Security:**

- Requires strong passwords
- Not shared with non-administrators
- Carefully controlled

### **Hard Links and Symbolic Links**

**Hard Link:**

- Another file pointing to same location
- Created with `ln` command
- Changes to hard-linked file affect original
- Limitations:
  - Difficult to locate
  - Limited to same file system
  - Cannot link to directories

**Symbolic Link (Symlink/Soft Link):**

- Similar to hard link (changes reflected)
- Created with `ln -s` command
- Shows original file location in `ls -l`
- Advantages over hard links:
  - Easy to locate (shows target)
  - Works across file systems
  - Can link to directories
- Disadvantage:
  - Single point of failure (if original deleted, symlink broken)

## **Rootkit Check**

### **Rootkit Definition**

- Malware increasing unauthorized user privileges
- Grants access to restricted software portions
- Often secures backdoor to compromised computer

### **Rootkit Installation**

**Methods:**

- Automated (part of infection)
- Manual (after compromise)

**Privilege Requirements:**

- Vast majority require root/administrator access
- Few vulnerabilities allow regular user installation

### **Rootkit Danger**

**Deep Compromise:**

- Changes kernel code and modules
- Modifies fundamental OS operations
- Hides intrusion
- Removes installation tracks
- Tampers with diagnostic tools
- Hides rootkit presence

### **Rootkit Detection**

**Difficulty:**

- Very difficult due to deep compromise
- Typical methods:
  - Boot from trusted media (diagnostics live CD)
  - Mount compromised drive
  - Use trusted diagnostic tools
  - Inspect compromised file system

**Detection Methods:**

- Behavioral-based analysis
- Signature scanning
- Difference scanning
- Memory dump analysis

### **Rootkit Removal**

**Challenge:**

- Complicated and often impossible
- Especially if in kernel

**Solution:**

- Operating system re-installation (usually only real solution)
- Firmware rootkits require hardware replacement

### **chkrootkit Tool**

**Purpose:**

- Popular Linux program for rootkit detection
- Shell script using common Linux tools

**How It Works:**

- Uses `strings` and `grep` commands
- Compares core program signatures
- Looks for discrepancies in /proc file system
- Compares signatures with `ps` output

**Limitations:**

- ⚠️ Not 100% reliable
- Helpful but not foolproof

## **Piping Commands**

### **Piping Concept**

**Definition:**

- Technique chaining commands together
- Output of one command = input of next
- Named after pipe character: `|`

**Purpose:**

- Combine simple tools for complex tasks
- Create powerful command sequences

### **Example: Filtering Output**

**Individual Commands:**

- `ls` - List files and directories
- `grep` - Search for specified string in text

**Piped Together:**

- `ls | grep [search_term]`
- Filters `ls` output to show only matching items

**Result:**

- More focused, useful output
- Combines command capabilities

- **Help:** `man [command]` for documentation
- **Philosophy:** Everything treated as file

### **Linux Servers and Clients**

- **Servers:** Provide services to clients across network
- **Services:** External resources (files, email, web) or maintenance tasks
- **Ports:** Reserved network resources for services
- **Well-Known Ports:** Standard ports for common services
- **Clients:** Applications communicating with specific server types
- **Protocols:** Well-defined communication standards

### **Basic Server Administration**

- **Configuration Files:** Manage services and settings
- **Hardening:** Secure device and administrative access
- **Best Practices:**
  - Physical security
  - Minimal packages
  - Disable unused services
  - SSH with root login disabled
  - Regular updates
  - Strong passwords
  - Periodic password changes
  - Prevent password reuse
- **Log Monitoring:** Track system health and security

### **Linux File System**

- **Types:** ext2, ext3, ext4, NFS, CDFS (vary by speed, flexibility, security, size)
- **Mounting:** Assign directory to partition for access
- **Root File System:** "/" contains all files by default
- **File Permissions:** Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x)
- **Permission Levels:** User, Group, Other
- **Hard Links:** Another file pointing to same location
- **Symbolic Links:** Similar to hard links with advantages (cross-filesystem, directory linking)

### **Linux GUI**

- **X Window System:** Basic GUI framework
- **Window Managers:** Define graphical interface (Gnome, KDE)
- **Customization:** Buttons, fonts, icons, colors, borders
- **Flexibility:** Can be replaced by user

### **Working on Linux Host**

- **Package Managers:** Install complex applications (apt, dpkg, pacman)
- **Updates:** Regular OS patches for vulnerability fixes
- **Processes:** Running program instances
- **Forking:** Kernel method for process creation
- **Scalability:** Apache example of fork efficiency

### **Security Concerns**

- **Malware:** Viruses, Trojans, worms (less vulnerable but not immune)
- **Attack Vectors:** Services, outdated software, kernel vulnerabilities
- **Rootkits:** Deep malware modifying kernel (difficult to detect/remove)
- **Detection Tools:** chkrootkit (helpful but not 100% reliable)

### **Command Techniques**

- **Piping:** Chain commands with `|` for complex operations
- **Example:** `ls | grep [term]` filters directory listing
